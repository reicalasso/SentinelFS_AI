## ðŸ”§ Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Production Validation
```bash
# 1. Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=sentinelzer0 --cov-report=html

# 2. Build Docker images
docker build -t sentinelzer0:3.8.0 .
docker build -t sentinelzer0:latest .

# 3. Run security scan
docker scan sentinelzer0:3.8.0

# 4. Test Docker Compose locally
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f sentinelzer0
```

### Phase 2: Staging Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy to staging environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d

# 2. Run smoke tests
python smoke_test_phase_3_1.py

# 3. Run E2E tests
pytest tests/test_phase_4_2_e2e.py -v

# 4. Monitor for 24 hours
# Check Grafana dashboards
# Review logs in Kibana
# Validate metrics in Prometheus
```

### Phase 3: Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Tag and push images
docker tag sentinelzer0:3.8.0 registry.example.com/sentinelzer0:3.8.0
docker push registry.example.com/sentinelzer0:3.8.0

# 2. Deploy with zero downtime
# Use blue-green or rolling deployment strategy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --no-deps --build sentinelzer0

# 3. Verify deployment
curl https://api.sentinelzer0.com/health
curl https://api.sentinelzer0.com/metrics

# 4. Monitor closely for first hour
# Watch error rates
# Monitor latency
# Check resource usage
```

## ðŸ“Š Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Grafana dashboards visible
- [ ] Logs flowing to aggregator
- [ ] No critical errors in logs

### Short-term Monitoring (1-24 hours)
- [ ] Response times within SLA
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1%
- [ ] CPU usage normal
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] GPU utilization optimal
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80%
- [ ] Model inference working correctly
- [ ] Adversarial detection functioning

### Long-term Validation (1-7 days)

- [ ] No resource exhaustion
- [ ] Backup jobs running successfully
- [ ] Log rotation working
- [ ] Metrics retention correct
- [ ] Auto-scaling functioning (if enabled)
- [ ] Alerting rules triggering appropriately
- [ ] User feedback positive
- [ ] No production incidents

## ðŸš¨ Rollback Plan

If issues are detected:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# 1. Stop current deployment
docker-compose down

# 2. Deploy previous version
docker pull registry.example.com/sentinelzer0:3.7.0
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# 3. Verify rollback
curl https://api.sentinelzer0.com/health
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# 1. Restore database from backup
pg_restore -d sentinelzer0 /backups/sentinelzer0_backup_latest.sql

# 2. Run down migrations if needed
alembic downgrade -1
```
