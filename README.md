This repository now contains only the production-ready SentinelFS AI inference stack and the reference model artifacts. Training utilities, experimental datasets, and development notebooks have been removed to deliver a lean deployment package.

## Whats Included

- `sentinelfs_ai/`: Python package with the behavioral analyzer, inference engine, model management helpers, and supporting data utilities
- `models/`: Reference checkpoints for the production ensemble (including `behavioral_analyzer_production.pt`)
- `load_model.py`: Simple script for loading the packaged model and running a quick inference demo
- `MODEL_REPORT.md`: Detailed performance report for the shipped model release (v1.0.0)
- `requirements.txt`: Minimal runtime dependencies required for inference and export workflows

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training Demo
```bash
python train_real_model.py
```

This demonstrates the complete workflow:
- ‚úÖ Feature extraction (30 real-world features)
- ‚úÖ Hybrid model training (GRU + Isolation Forest + Heuristics)
- ‚úÖ Real-time inference testing (<25ms)
- ‚úÖ Production monitoring and evaluation

### Production Usage

```python
from sentinelfs_ai import (
    HybridThreatDetector,
    RealFeatureExtractor,
    RealTimeInferenceEngine,
    ProductionEvaluator
)

# Initialize components
feature_extractor = RealFeatureExtractor()
model = HybridThreatDetector(
    input_size=30,
    hidden_size=128,
    num_layers=2,
    dropout=0.3
)

# Load trained model
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoints/final/model.pt')
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])

# Create inference engine
engine = RealTimeInferenceEngine(
    model=model,
    feature_extractor=feature_extractor,
    threat_threshold=0.7,
    cache_size=10000
)

# Analyze file system events
threat_score, threat_type, confidence = engine.predict(file_events)
if threat_score > 0.7:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Threat detected: {threat_type} (confidence: {confidence:.1%})")
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Validation Accuracy** | 97.4% |
| **F1 Score** | 91.5% |
| **Inference Latency** | <25ms |
| **Training Time** | ~8 seconds (20 epochs) |
| **GPU Support** | ‚úÖ CUDA enabled |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

**HybridThreatDetector** - Three-component ensemble:
- **40%** GRU Neural Network - Sequential pattern learning
- **30%** Isolation Forest - Unsupervised anomaly detection
- **30%** Heuristic Rules - Domain-specific threat indicators

**Features** - 30 real-world indicators:
- Temporal patterns (access frequency, time-of-day)
- File characteristics (size, type, entropy)
- Behavioral signals (velocity, modification rate)
- Security indicators (ransomware patterns, suspicious extensions)
